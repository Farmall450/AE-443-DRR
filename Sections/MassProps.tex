\subsection{Comparison Analysis}
\label{subsection: comparison}
Given the preliminary geometry of the aircraft, the mass properties of the aircraft were calculated and tabulated in Table \ref{tab:mass_props}. In these calculations, the only source of equations used and analyzed came from Raymer \cite{raymer}, equations from Roskam (both Part II \cite{roskam_2} and Part V \cite{roskam_5}) are not taken into account.

The CG of the aircraft was also estimated using the estimation provided by Raymer \cite{raymer}, which states the CG is roughly located at 30\% MAC from the tip of the root chord. From the computer model of the aircraft, the CG is estimated to be 1034 inches (86 feet) from the nose of the aircraft, or 1174 inches (98 feet) from the aircraft coordinate system.


\subsection{Future Work}
Using the aircraft in Table \ref{tab:trade_params} and other seed aircraft, the fidelity of the mass estimation equations found in Roskam Part 2 \cite{roskam_2}, Roskam Part 5 \cite{roskam_5}, and Raymer \cite{raymer} can be quantified. By choosing the equations which closely fit the values seen in the real aircraft from the trade study rather than equations which may over or under estimate the mass, a higher fidelity prediction of the total mass of the aircraft can be created. Another method of estimating the mass properties of the aircraft would be to create a high-detailed CAD model of the aircraft, where materials are assigned to each part of the structure with enough detail such that the weight, CG, and moments of inertia can be estimated via the CAD software.
