The aircraft will feature three bogeys of retractable landing gear customary of that found on similar aircraft within the \hl{ref. trade study} of comparable aircraft.  Tentatively, the front assembly will be composed of two wheels, and the rears two symmetric sets of three wheels.  All bogeys will be hydraulically mounted to dampen the impact seen upon touchdown.  The three-bogey arrangement is traditionally seen due to both the stability of three on uneven surfaces as well as the weight distribution of the aircraft.  The front gear will also feature the main taxi light.  

@Chris: not sure if terminology is what you wish to use (e.g. bogey, etc)

Future work will consist of an analysis of the load and stress placed on the landing gear during taxi, takeoff, and, most importantly, landing.  Additional consideration will be taken to ensure the landing gear and its related hydraulic \hl{and pneaumatic/electrical?} systems stow within the contour of the fuselage as developed by aerodynamics.  Furthermore, brake sizing and fitment inside the wheel will be verified.
