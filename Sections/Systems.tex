The Sam Mark I includes every system that is compulsory in order to satisfy the given requirements meanwhile optimizing the aircraft's safety, and comfortability. The aircraft's main systems are flight controls, deicing systems, engine control systems, environmental control systems, fuel systems, battery systems, along with an electrical and hydraulic system. These systems were chosen to provide the aircraft with the latest system technologies that are not present in older aircraft, and to provide safe flights. Due to the fact that the Sam Mark I is a large aircraft, each system has a redundancy factor built into it in case of a malfunction of any part. There are currently no schematics or demonstration figure in this report, but there will be in the final report. Other future work includes discussion of multiple types of the same system, and why the chosen type is best suited for the Sam Mark I.
