The following design report represents the basis for a new aircraft developed by Team Toucan at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in response to AIAA's Request for Proposal\cite{RFP} addressing the industry need for a large capacity, short to medium haul widebody capable of mitigating the increased traffic and congestion found at many modern airports.  While the design aircraft will be capable of carrying up to 400 passengers up to 3,500 nautical miles, it has been engineered to bridge the gap between low capacity, short range regional jets and high capacity, long range twin jets currently on the market.  This report validates the possibility of addressing the prescribed requirements in a commercial aircraft.

Prominent driving design points of the Sam Mark I include takeoff and landing distances under 9,000 ft, maximum range of 3,500 nm, capacity of 400 passengers and their respective luggage, 10 person crew (2 pilots, 8 flight attendants), cruise altitude of 37,000 ft, adherence to FAA Part 25 regulations and fundamental desire to maximize customer value through minimizing fuel consumption as well as other operating costs.  Cabin pressure will not exceed 8,000 ft, and 5 ft$^3$ of luggage space will be available per customer, increasing passenger comfort.  The proposed aircraft will be service ready by 2029 and has been designed as a twin engine, twin aisle widebody with a traditional tail.  Most notably, the entire wing including its sub-structure will be designed and manufactured utilizing modern composites to minimize structural weight while not sacrificing performance or longevity.  Other value-added design points include leading and trailing edge high lift devices, VFR and IFR flight with autopilot, and de-icing capability.

To date, preliminary sizing of the aircraft is nearing completion.  \textbf{MTOW weight is 550,000 lb, of which \hl{XXXX} is fuel, POWER REQUIREMENT, M=.9 etc per Mat} The seed and fundamental based estimations in this report are fluid, and moving forward Team Toucan will be performing in-depth analysis of all major components to fully optimize the design to the driving design points.  Leading edge slats and trailing edge, Fowler-type flaps will be designed and integrated into the wing structure to efficiently generate lift under critical conditions.  Final design will follow a detailed FEA and CFD analysis of the aircraft's aerodynamic surfaces and structure in order to ensure flight worthiness.  Additionally, a component wise weight build up of corrected values for hybrid construction will supplement an in-depth stability and control analysis.  Final design will be completed within the next two months, leaving adequate time for review, system integration check, and submission by the May 14th, 2020 deadline.
