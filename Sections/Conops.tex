\textcolor{red}{
\begin{itemize}
    \item AIAA: A description of the design missions defined for the proposed concepts for use in
calculations of mission performance as per design objectives. This includes the
selection of cruise altitude(s) and cruise speed/cruise Mach supported by pertinent
trade analyses and discussion.
    \item Discuss requirements (including those from the RFP and any additional derived requirements), constraints, and the design mission.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Include a table of requirements.
        \item Include a figure of the design mission with key mission segments labeled and details noted (e.g. cruise range and altitude).
